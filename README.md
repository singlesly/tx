# tx

**tx** is a distributed network for transaction management, similar to banking or cryptocurrency systems. The project provides tools for handling transfers, fund issuance, and commission deduction, ensuring high performance and reliability.

## Problem Solved by the Project

Modern transaction management systems often face challenges related to processing speed, scalability, and integration complexity. **tx** offers a solution that combines the advantages of high-speed data processing with a distributed architecture based on a P2P network.

## Key Benefits

1. **Speed**: Powered by **BadgerDB** and **Go**, the system delivers low latency and high performance for transaction processing.
2. **Distributed Network**: The P2P-based architecture ensures fault tolerance and scalability.
3. **User-Friendly API**: The **gRPC API** enables seamless integration of network nodes with external applications and systems.

## Features

- **Transfers**: Simple and reliable management of transfers between network participants.
- **Fund Issuance**: Flexible mechanisms for creating new assets.
- **Commission Deduction**: Automated handling of transaction fees.

## What Problems This Project Does Not Aim to Solve

- **Consensus Between Nodes**: By default, it is assumed that all nodes are truthful. This project does not include mechanisms to ensure consensus.
- **Blockchain Technology**: This is not a blockchain. There are no links to previous blocks or even blocks at all.

## Purpose of the Service

- If you need a reliable system for transaction management, the type of transactions created depends entirely on your requirements and the requests you send to the network. Think of it as a specialized database for managing transactions.
- If you need a distributed, fault-tolerant transaction management mechanism that can undergo certification and licensing.


## Architecture

- **P2P Network**: Nodes communicate directly, eliminating single points of failure.
- **BadgerDB**: A high-performance embedded database for fast data access.
- **gRPC API**: Easy integration with support for multiple programming languages.
